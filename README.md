# Crazy-Space-Survival-Adventure

## This is a simple Java space game which i have done to learn Java. Many things (or everything) is in german and this game is only a Java learning game. You can't play this game for long because it isn't much fun. I watched tutorials to make this game happen, added many things myself and fixed bugs. 

This game is just a simple space game with a rocket which can shoot, asteroids, collectables, a fitting soundtrack, upgrades, menu,... . 
The game will be faster and faster after some time to increase the difficulty.
Feel free to add a pull request or an issue. I might learn something from it because I'm still not a profi wiht java.
