# Crazy Space Survival Adventure

This is a simple Java space game which I programmed to learn Java. 
Many things (or everything) is in german and this game is only a Java learning game. 
You can't play this game for long because it isn't much fun. I watched tutorials to make this game happen, added many things myself and fixed bugs. 


This game is just a simple space game with a rocket which can shoot, collectables, asteroids, a fitting soundtrack, upgrades, menu,... . 
The game will gain speed after some time to increase the difficulty.
Use ESC if you start the game to pause and to look into every menu. 
Yes the window should be so small.
And yes this game may be buggy or not good optimized or has weird hitboxes,... but yeah, I learned much from this game.

You can donwload it if you select the green button named "Code" then "Download ZIP". Extract the downloaded ZIP folder and then open the game by opening the .jar file.

Feel free to add a pull request or an issue. I might learn something from it because I'm still not a profi with java.
