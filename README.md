# Crazy Space Survival Adventure

This is a simple Java space game which I programmed to learn Java. 
The game is in German and was only made to learn more about Java. 
I watched tutorials to make this game happen, added many things myself and fixed bugs. 

This game is just a simple space game with a rocket which can shoot, collectables, asteroids, a fitting soundtrack, upgrades, menu, ... . 
The game will gain speed after some time to increase the difficulty.
Use ESC if you start the game to pause and to look into every menu. 
The window size can't be changed and this game may be buggy or not good optimized but I learned a lot from this game.

Here are some screenshots to show how the game looks like:

You can download it if you select the green button named "Code" then "Download ZIP" or download the ZIP file over the releases tab. 
Extract the downloaded zip folder and then open the game by opening the .jar file.

Feel free to add a pull request or an issue. I might learn something from it because I am still learning.
