# Crazy Space Survival Adventure

## What is this?
This is a simple Java space game with a rocket which can shoot, collectables, asteroids, a fitting soundtrack, upgrades, menu and more which I programmed to learn Java. <br>
The game will gain speed after some time to increase the difficulty. <br>
Use the escape key if you start the game to pause it and to look into every menu. <br>
The window size can't be changed and this game may be buggy or not good optimized but I learned a lot from this game. <br>
It's in German and I watched tutorials to make this game happen while also adding many things myself and fixing bugs.

## How to install?
**You need [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download) to play this game!** <br>
You can download it if you select the green button named "Code" then "Download ZIP" or download the ZIP file over the releases tab. <br>
Extract the downloaded ZIP file and then open the game by opening the .jar file.
